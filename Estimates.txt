- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
	The recovery time requried for AZ outages is 35 seconds, since the DB will automatically failover to the secondary region.

- Minimum RTO for a single region outage
	The recovery time requried for region outages is the sum of the following activities:
		* Connecting & logging in to AWS (10 min)
		* Finding the root cause of the issues, time until its realized that the region is down (15 min)
		* Connecting the applications to the read-replica manually, commit the code change, and redeploy (30 min)	
	 Hence, an RTO of 1 hour should be a safe estimate. Moreover, if we are strictly talking about the DB,the TRO is going to be less since the applications are a different out of scope in that case.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
		There is no dataloss in multi-az RDS deployments:

Minimum RPO for a single region outage
		It is expected to have up to 5 minutes lag (data-loss) between to regions for MySQL cross-region read replicas.
		So and RPO for 6 minutes should be a safe number.
